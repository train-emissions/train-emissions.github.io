                <p class="lead">In this case, there were two major parts which are preparing method to assume emission details and validating of it. By using analytical method and regression analysis, software has been developed. For validate software, manually emission inventory has been prepared by using existing data of locomotive available in SLR.</p>

                <p class="lead">To prepare emission inventory, average fuel consumption has been used. For that fuel inlet and running data of July 2014 has been used. From those data average fuel consumption rate for each locomotive has been calculated. Initially before selecting the time duration, monthly fuel consumption of each engine has been checked for year 2013. For single engine type, between two months there are no considerable variation of fuel consumption rate. There for monthly data has been used to find average fuel consumption rate</p>

                <p class="lead">Over those, as mention in methodology, emission inventory has been prepared, but there are some drawbacks on this which are not consider while preparing. In this method track variations has not been considered not only that variation due to weather conditions also not accounted. Load of the locomotive is another factor that need to consider while preparing the inventory. Load of the locomotive is depends on the passenger volume, that is another factor that which couldn’t allocating while using fuel consumption. Because of those reasons, exact fuel consumption and exact emission is not represent in between two station. No specific emission has been calculated. In this case only factor that affecting on fuel consumption is locomotive condition.</p>

                <p class="lead">Because of above reason prepared inventory is not exactly correct. To minimize above reasons, case study has been conducted. That case study has been conducted to only one locomotive type because of the limitation mention in early chapter. This case study has been done to minimize the drawback occurred in because of above reasons.</p>

                <p class="lead">Above mention drawbacks can be predicted, but there are some factors effect on fuel consumption which cannot be predicted such as delays due to signal failures, delays due to damage on railway tracks, delays due to unexpected traffic conjunction and railway accidents. Localise fuel wastage occurred because of this reasons, there for emission also higher in the areas that occurs, but with the methodology followed to prepare this inventory those emission accounted for the total journey.</p>

                <p class="lead">To avoid these errors, real time measuring procedure needs to be allocated. But with the existing system, it is hard task because, there are no any locomotive with flow meter to measure fuel consumption. Not only that still SLR couldn’t run any program to measure emission of SLR locomotives. </p>

                <p class="lead">SLR couldn’t have records of some locomotives such as W3. Available data of some locomotives are not enough to calculate average consumption. In some S8 locomotives running distance is not available. There for while preparing this inventory, effect of those unavailable data has been neglected. Other than that emergency trains and trains used to pull breakdown trains also neglected (Y engines).</p>

                <p class="lead">Analytical method that used in this research is based on set of assumptions which are stats on earlier chapters. Some factors that has been mention in early paragraphs are over come up to considerable level such as track characteristic variations and other depended variables which are unique to train number. Anyhow still unable to catch up some factors such as weather conditions and unpredictable delays such as traffic conjunction, and accidents.</p>

                <p class="lead">One of the factor that make high impact on the fuel consumption is driving pattern. Driving pattern of the locomotive is depend on the driver’s experience and abilities and it is unique to the driver. But in this case it is assumed to be fixed by giving precedence to reaching the next stop on time, but in practical scenario this time can be limit or exceed that because of delays or drivers ability. </p>

                <p class="lead">As mention in above paragraph, precedence is given to the travel time between two stations. though while assuming acceleration encountered problem is that acceleration is depend on the velocity achieved, but achievable velocity is depend on the accelerations hence resistance throughout the journey between following two station be considered as constant. From that made an assumption acceleration between two stations is constant. </p>

                <p class="lead">While assuming deceleration, assumed that deceleration and acceleration values are equal between following two station. But to avoid slipping deceleration cannot exceed over 0.6 ms<sup>-1</sup>. If any case, whether acceleration exceed 0.6 ms<sup>-1</sup>, deceleration value is get as 0.6 ms<sup>-1</sup>.</p>

                <p class="lead">Emission factors which used in this project is reserved from the environmental protection authority of USA from the research which is done in 2013. But these details are correct only for the Canadian locomotive. In Sri Lanka there are locomotives which was manufactured in Canada, France, India, Germany, Britain and china. There for there is a considerable variation in locomotive emissions. Another assumption that made while selecting emission factors is all locomotive which is in similar type has same emissions. This would make considerable deviation on emission inventory compared to real emission.</p>
