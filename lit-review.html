                    <p class="lead">
                        Since the beginning of 19th century while the time that mumbles started the passenger transportation railway so many developments were carried in the field [4]. Those development are carried out through the different field such as passenger comfort, synchronized transportation networks, fuel efficiency and carbon footprint, application of latest technology and marketing aspects.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        While studying about existing railway management systems, targeted on few prominent railway networks. Those are London underground railway network, Hong Kong MTR and Indian railway. London underground is oldest underground railway that involve in passenger transportation, it is a subsidiary of transport for London network. Hong Kong MTR is one of the leading railway transportation network which is influenced from London Underground and mage by private sector. Indian railway is one of the railway network which make largest number of passenger and goods transportation.

                    <h3>Passenger comfort, reliability and safety</h3>
                    <p class="lead">
                        As the oldest railway tunnel in the world, London Underground is concern about the passenger comfort, though they were able to achieve farebox recovery ratio of 100% in 2004 [5]. Reliability and punctuality is necessary condition for London underground railway because London underground Railway is subsidiary of “transport for London” network, which are synchronized with each and every transporting media which are used in London city. Likewise, to shield the safety of passenger many action has been taken such as spider web which is to coat pickpocket holders, this is a joint venture of the British transport police and TLF cooperation. Poster campaign about the adverse effects of careless mistakes to address the odious to minimize careless mistakes [6].

                        Hong Kong MTR (Mass Transit Railway) is also one of the most reliable transport network, this system is affected from the London Underground Railway system, because Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997. Its development was able to lead the London Underground railway by maintaining farebox recovery ratio of 149% in 2007 and 186% in 2009 [5, 7]. However punctuality of MTR train in 99.9% [8]. There are special police patrols working on every station to maintain the safety of the MTR passenger as join venture of Hong Kong police and MTR cooperation, other than that all the operation are watched by using CCTV cameras to check whether that there any misuse behaviors are occurred [9]. Airport expressway of MTR from Asia expo to Hong Kong airport is more reliable, it has facility to transport luggage directly to airport cargo from railway station at Asia expo, and it takes approximately 25 minutes travel 35.5km through this railway [10], 
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Nowadays there are many railway transportation networks are affected from above two system such as Dubai Metro, Singapore Metro and New Zealand Metro. Though likewise to have more safe and reliable train journeys in Sri Lanka, those fact mention in above can be applicable, for example to increase the safety of passenger, SLR be able to come up agreement with Sri Lanka police to have station police patrols. Sri Lanka, delay of one train leads to delay all the other train running on that track, because there are no facility to cross two train in everywhere, they can do it only in special station, though other trains have to stop at those stations until delay train arrived, which is not reliable. Though to minimize those things MTR optimize their operations to maintain punctuality, if any reason any train was delay, MTR send it through the minimum affected procedure. Even in Sri Lanka, by optimizing the operation, can minimize the delay of train and reliability of the network.

                    <h3>Synchronized transportation network</h3>
                    <p class="lead">
                        London underground is the subsidiary of the “Transport For London” (TLF) network, all the public transportation media of the TLF network has been connected to each other [11]. Hong Kong MTR also like that, those are synchronized with the Hong Kong bus network and even with the Airport (airport expressway railway line) [10]. Not only that, but also Hong Kong MTR is synchronized with the other three nearby railway lines which MTR can access [10]. Indian railway was able to run their train according to their own strategy, Indian railway are having intercity trains and those are stop only at the main stations, there are small trains which are going to mains station from substations, those two types of trains are synchronized, though passengers who want to travel long distance they have to come to the main station, to arrive main station, they can use train which are stopped at substation [12]. This optimizing program is made to minimize train waiting time at the stations. In Sri Lanka also we can have synchronize transportation network, as the initial step SLTB bus network and train, for an example if there is an office train which is departure at 7.30 a.m. from Panadura railway station, SLTB bus network can be planned to arrive to near Panadura station by 7.15 a.m. from different arias such as Horana, Wadduwa, and in the evening vice versa of the operation can be done, if the train arrive at 6.00 p.m. & bus network can be there which departure at 6.15 from Panadura station. Number of passengers for long distance traveling is less in SLR, one of the main reason for that is time taken for the traveling is higher than bus transportation duration [13, 14, 15]. Though the method that Indian has used can be applied to the Sri Lanka according to the condition, to travel from the substation to main station, no need to have train for that, small rail vehicle which is powered by using electricity or engine can be used.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Energy Efficiency and carbon footprint of train</h3>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Efficiency of the train is important factor to minimize the carbon footprint of the train. Efficiency of the train depends on many conditions such as weight of train, number of cabins, number of passenger and amount of freight, type of locomotive, and road condition such as incline [13, 14]. London Underground railway has 197,077 litres of gasoil consumption of fuel annually [11], though to have good energy efficiency and to increase environmental protection, London underground maintains good maintenance, replacement, and service schedule for their trains and other related components [11]. TFL have introduced many energy saving plans such as replacing lighting of train with LED lights, use aluminum conductor rail, rescheduling railway timeline [16, 11]. Other than that TFL has an agreement with SIEMENS cooperation to have more efficient train and there is ongoing project to minimize energy consumption of London Underground [17].

                        MTR also aware about carbon footprint and energy efficiency, there for MTR modify their train lighting and they have included LED lighting systems for trains and stations, that decision save 40% of lighting energy requirement [19]. MTR has identified some project areas such as recovery and reuse energy which generated inside the train breaking systems. Optimization of tunnel ventilation, fine tuning of train speed and acceleration, this can be used to reduce motor operation and energy conservation [10, 19]. MTR has energy utilization plan which comes under three categories, those are Propulsion Energy (motoring and breaking), Auxiliary Power (Lighting, Air conditioning, Control & Communications), and Traction Energy Distribution Lost (Overhead Line, Voltage conversion). MTR consider about new technologies and design changes to utilize energy in railway transportation, those are mention in below, those are reduction of Train Weight (Composition materials trains, Li ion battery), Higher Efficiency Traction System (Permanent magnet motor), Reduce Unproductive Dwell Time (Adoption of UTO, Will be adopted in SIL  and NEL  of Hong Kong MTR). These are the existing and future plans of Hong Kong MTR for energy utilization [20, 10].

                        Energy saving is highly considering factor, because most of train that they are using is fossil fuel powered engines, and they are one of the most railway operating company. Most of Indian locomotives are designed in India, while developing design, traveling route and the traveling distance are considered as the main factors [12], to utilize energy, India is going to use solar power for lighting and air conditioning [21, 22].

                        In Sri Lanka there is annual diesel consumption of 35024312 liters [23]. Though carbon emission also very high, efficiency of the train also lower than manufactures manual [14]. Reasons for these are discuss in the next chapter. Though SLR need to be aware of energy consumption though they have areas to minimize the energy consumption by replacing lighting technology with LED lighting, minimizing of train waiting time and fine tuning of speed and acceleration according to Sri Lankan conditions can be reduced the energy usage. Other than those purchasing of new engine should be done according to the route conditions, climate and travelling distance. In Sri Lanka demand of long distance trains are having seasonal demand, but every day those trains are travel the distance, but number of cabin included for the train is not changed, if there is procedure to change number of cabins included according to demand, energy apply for the each cabin will reduce there is no calculated amount of energy saving per cabin, but considerable amount of energy can be save with compare to consumption [14]. Operation optimization can be reduced the energy consumption and carbon footprint, for an example if operation synchronized as mention in previous sub topic, overall number of train uses are increase, though usage of busses and private transportation media will be reduced. There for overall fuel consumption of country can be reduced. Other than those, as a long term plan, Sri Lanka can move to electric train rather than using diesel electrical locomotives.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">EMISSION INVENTORIES</h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Emission inventories are prepared for the many tasks. Those were prepared for particular area or particular region such as ports or systems like railway system or for particular town or state. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        While preparing emission inventories for no road diesel engine vehicles, in most of cases in fuel based emission inventories, emission factor is used as multiplier with diesel fuel consumed to obtain the emission in off road diesel engines [24]. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        While going on operation of the locomotive, exhaust of the locomotive emits multiple type of gasses to the environment. From those CO2 is the basic exhaust other than that CO, NOx, PM and HC are the most significant elements that contain in exhaust of the Diesel locomotives and power sets [25]. By the time in most cases, locomotives are used low sulphur fuel. There for emission of sulphur can be neglected [26].
                    </p>
                    <h3>Preparing emission inventories</h3>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Locomotive are consisting two major type of transportation systems. Line haul locomotives and switching locomotives. These are normally long distance travelling locomotives, most of the time used for freight transportation. Number of stop between start station and end station is low. Hence fuel consumption rate of these type of locomotives are low while consider with horsepower but most of the time hi power locomotives are been used [27]. Switching locomotives are the locomotives that are mostly used for passenger transportation and number of stops between two stations are higher [27], most of Sri Lanka railway locomotives are same as switching locomotives
                    </p>
                    <h3>Methodology for forming emission inventory</h3>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Separation of rail road operations as line haul transportation and switching transportation. After that obtain relevant information from the log books or conducting a survey. Specially related with the area that going to prepare emission inventory. Calculating data by analyzing information for each train operation. Extrapolate calculated data for relevant period [25].
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        To prepare emission inventory, there need to collect relevant information. To collect information there can be run few procedures which port of Long Beach has been run, those are previous emission studies, from the cargo and passenger statics and input from rail road operations or already recorded [27]. For Sri Lankan railway there are no previously developed emission inventories. There for previously collected data has been used to prepare inventory.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Categorization of locomotives</h3>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Locomotive categorization is relevant to prepare an emission inventory. To categorize locomotive in to tiers, many procedures are been used based on the performances. One method is to allocate locomotive in to tiers is using manufacturing year. Other than that manufacturing technology, manufacturer, transmission technique, efficiency of components, horsepower and engine capacity would effect on locomotive performances. Over that using emission data of the locomotives, by using experimental values locomotive can be allocated in to tiers [26]. This experiment can be done using loading conditions or no load conditions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Fuel consumption of locomotive</h3>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Locomotives are used medium speed engines. Normally those are over 1000 hp large engines. These engine fuel consumption rates affected from some factors, those are locomotive condition, locomotive performances, and power transition system. Over that driving resistance are affected specially rolling resistance, gradient resistance and curve resistance and for high speed trains Drag resistance. Other than those measurable factors, driving pattern is affecting parameter which depend on thezx Locomotive pilot. To optimize and identify driving pattern, there need to carry out research based on fuel consumption [28].

                    <h2 class="section-heading">FUEL CONSUMPTION</h2>
                    <p class="lead">To develop emission inventory, fuel consumption considered as basis. There are factors that influence on the fuel consumption which have been identified. To quantify the fuel consumption analytical method and regression analysis can be used[29].</p>

                    <p class="lead">There are factors that effect on fuel consumption. Those are train resistance, Rolling stock characteristics, impact on operational strategies, impact of infrastructure configuration on energy consumption during travelling, and breakdown factors that influence on the operation[29].</p>

                    <p class="lead">There are few type of resistance that are act on trains, as according to the literature those are as follows. Rolling resistance, bearing friction, track resistance, are considered as running resistances. Other than that Air resistance and flange friction are the resistance that effect on the train resistance[29].</p>

                    <p class="lead">Under rolling stock characteristics aerodynamic of locomotive, seating height, width and height, distributed motorization, type of connection between cars, train length and operational consideration such as number of passengers can be run in each carriage, cargo capacity[29].</p>

                    <p class="lead">Similarly operation strategies are also make impact on fuel consumption. Those are timetable margin, economic driving and impact of intermediate stops. Number of stops and time that has been stopped at a station[29].</p>

                    <p class="lead"> Impact of infrastructure configuration is the highly affecting factor of fuel economy. Factors that are dealing with this are vertical and horizontal alignments of route (curvatures and incline), route length and speed restrictions[29].</p>

                    <p class="lead">Other than that, mechanical resistances, downhill breaking losses, onboard breaking losses, energy recuperated via regenerative breaking are the factors that can make difference to the fuel consumption. All these factors that has been discuss within this chapter are relevant for the SLR locomotive fuel consumption. Above are used to analyses data in analytical method[29].</p>

                    <p class="lead">Fuel consumption is directly relating factor for carbon emission, in most cases, for non-road vehicles emission inventory has been developed based on number of hours that has been used. But in Sri Lankan condition, running hours are not available for all the type of locomotive. There for emission inventor that is going to prepare was based on fuel consumption rate per kilometer [28].</p>

                    <p class="lead">This model for fuel consumption is technological based inventory. Determining the energy consumption and air pollution are directly related as said in previously. There are some advantages in this method, major advantage is that using this method it can be easily updated [28].</p>

                    <p class="lead">Changes of the acceleration, maximum speed can be extrapolate by using method like this which is based on fuel consumption in physical point of view. Locomotives can be categorized in to categories and experiment and case studies can be perform according to the categorization [28].</p>

                    <p class="lead">While following this method major problem that in cooperate with is driving pattern of the locomotive cannot be allocated. Driving pattern would be changes with the driver of the locomotive [28]. In this case driving pattern of the locomotive has been considered as neglecting factor.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Most of Sri Lankan locomotives are Diesel electric locomotives. Hence efficiency of electronic component and electronic transmission is one of the factor that influence on locomotive fuel consumption.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Locomotive categorization and procedure that has been used is discussed in following paragraphs</p>

                    <p class="lead">
                        Development of Sri Lankan railway is carried out under six categories in recent past, those are increasing operating speed from 80 km/h to 100 km/h, construction of new railway lines, increasing of rolling stock fleet, rehabilitation of signaling and telecommunication, electrification, information technology.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead">
                        To optimize operation it is necessary to run locomotives and engine power sets its optimal working condition to maintain reliability of intercity train. It is important to increase running speed of train based on locomotive conditions, by the time most of Sri Lankan railway track can produce only up to 80 km/h, though SLR selected some railway track mention in below to develop the achievable speed of track is up to 100 km/h. regarding this, SLR going to increase the railway operation by having new railway tracks. Those tracks are able to achieve the speed of 120km/h speed [30]. To increase the interaction between passengers and railway department, latest technologies are going to introduced, aspects such as electronic payments, mobile seat reservation, SLR e-pension system, train tracking and operating information system.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead">
                        Sri Lanka railway is a service provider rather than a profitable organization which operates with operational loss, and SLR spend around four billion rupees per calendar year for fuel, there for as mention in research gap, our target is to build up a train management system fuel consumption as basis. On behalf of that to optimize the operation fuel economy as basis utilization of rolling stocks is one of the leading factor that need to concern while optimizing operations. In Sri Lanka there are 240 locomotives and power sets which are used to power trains, most locomotives which are used in Sri Lanka cannot run in an every route, though there are specific engine types for specific route. Next chapter is containing details about Locomotives in Sri Lanka and their usage.

                    <p class="lead">
                        Sri Lankan railways were developed mostly in British colonial period. It is operational since 1864. Sri Lankan Railways operates the country’s railway network, which includes about 1,420 km. Electrification of the busiest sections of the network was proposed in 2010, to improve energy efficiency and sustainability, but it is not been initialized. There is a predictive models based on linear programming used for determine optimal train schedules in metro lines. Most of the trains used in other countries are electrical. But in Sri Lanka due to high capital cost, electrification is not yet initialized. Currently most of the locomotives in operation are Diesel-Electric, Diesel-Hydraulic or Diesel multiple units (DMU) [13].

                    <p class="lead">
                        Locomotive is the vital component for the train to take away passengers or freight or serves as shunting purpose. Locomotives are being categorized according to the engine type, length and width of bogie, power produced, capacity, wheel arrangement tiers according to the year of manufactured.

                    <p class="lead">
                        There are so many researches and experiments to evaluate the efficiency of the locomotives and minimize the fuel consumption and environmental pollution. In the part of the maximizing efficiency of locomotive-engines and fuel types are consider to the literature review.

                        Fuel efficiency of the locomotive change with the locomotive type, fuel consumption and emissions are relate with each other. Considering different factors, locomotive has been categories in to tiers. While allocating to the tiers highly concentrated on manufacturing year. Next factor that consider is operation method, whether it is line haul locomotive or switching locomotive. Line haul trains are the trains that travel long distance such as intercity trains and switching locomotives are short distance traveling and number of stops between two stations are high [33].

                    <h3>Current train management system</h3>

                    <p class="lead">In Sri Lankan context the current Train management system’s basis is not clear. Following procedure is followed through the operations in Sri Lanka Railways. </p>
                    <p class="lead">According to the current timetable, when a train is departure from a starting point the priority of the train is given according to the nature of the train. The Working timetable elaborates the Priority of the trains and which particular train passes which train. Normally Working time table has the information about time that each train reaches each station in the route. Working time table is operated if there isn’t a breakdown in the rail tracks or accidents like derailments. The operations are observed.</p>
                    <p class="lead">A train is stopped at a station for one minute and if it is a junction or a crowded station as Ragama, Maradana and Gampaha, the train is stopped at a station for two minutes.</p>

                    <p class="lead">All the locomotives cannot be used in all the train routes. There are some train routes, that some locomotives cannot be used, because of the nature of the train route the suitable locomotive or diesel multiple unit is selected. </p>
                    <p class="lead">Normally the number of carriages depends on couple of factors. Passenger distribution on the trip is one and the other determining factor is the passenger distribution in the trip back to the starting point. Normally a train is not coming back without passengers. The train’s number of carriages is not changed according to the passenger distribution.</p>
