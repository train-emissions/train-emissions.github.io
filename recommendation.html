                <!-- <div class="col-lg-5 col-sm-6"> -->
                    <!-- <hr class="section-heading-spacer"> -->

                <h2 class="section-heading">Recommendation</h2>
                <p class="lead">As mention in discussion, this project is done under many assumptions, to avoid those assumption and get real values, there need to be done lots of future works. From those works, initial step is categorization of locomotives according to the emissions. For that, it is necessary to do emission test for all operating locomotive available in the SLR, afterwards those locomotives needs to categorize by standardizing the emissions. With the usage of locomotives and while it getting older and older emissions would be increased. Hence to minimize that error our recommendation is, do emission test for locomotive at every service routine and update them with the system.</p>

                <p class="lead">Rolling resistance and aero dynamic resistances are functions of velocity. So when velocity increases with the time, resistance would be increase, hence if loco is running with constant power acceleration would be reduced. This would be depend on the maximum velocity that can achieve. </p>

                <p class="lead">As mention in the discussion, driving pattern make considerable impact on the train fuel consumption, to minimize the variation of the driving pattern and fine tune the driving operation. Fine tuning of driving pattern and training locomotive drivers according to the model pattern would help to reduce fuel consumption. Hence emissions also reduced. There for performing a research to fine tune the driving pattern would be help to improve the quality of railway system.</p>

                <p class="lead">Not only that fine tuning of driving pattern will increase the accuracy of the software that prepared to quantify emissions. From that it would help to catch up accelerations, decelerations and maximum velocities that can be achieved.</p>

                <p class="lead">When selecting driving style there are some factors that needs to prioritize, from those most important for the railway system is reach the following railway station at scheduled time. To achieve that target it is important to achieve minimum of speed limits at the possible acceleration. Hence it is driver’s responsibility that not to increase speed after reaching maximum speed limit and not to decrease speed if it not required. Science the driver going in the minimum of speed limits the driver doesn’t need to decelerate after reaching the lower speed limit. As mention in early maximum speed that can be achieved without slipping is 0.6 ms<sup>-2</sup>. This can be vary with the route inline and other conditions. So it also can be find with the research on optimizing driving pattern.</p>

                <p class="lead">Load carrying of the locomotive is another factor that relate with fuel consumption. Hence while preparing this analytical model made assumption that load will depend on passenger capacity. With the interview with Mr Chandrasena from commercial department of SLR, passenger capacity accounted in to four different discrete levels. It is not according to any scientific analysis, Mr Chandrasena told about those fact with his experiences. Hence it is necessary to do research on passenger distribution and variation for the success of this model. Not only that it would be use full them for scheduling purpose and to improve the market share of trains.</p>

                <p class="lead">The grade resistance is taken by taking the tangent of that and stop station for a driving cycle, is that the resistance will be the same for driving cycle. In the case altitude variation of the profile is not accounted as it is. There are variation of altitude in between two stations increases and decreases of altitude. Not only that curve resistance and condition of roads such as broken bridge are some other factors limits the maximum achievable speed and acceleration. Hence this is also one of the factor that make changes to the driving pattern and fuel consumption.</p>

                <p class="lead">There are many advantages in these types of inventories. Especially system like railway, those are the systems to identify the drawbacks and areas that need to be developed. Hence these methodology can be used to compare variations in the system between two time periods. Periodical changes can be obtain, and to supply more environmentally friendly transport system and to identify the areas which can minimize the impact on environment.</p>
