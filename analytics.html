                        The energy requirements of a freight or passenger movement are a function of speed, weight, and resistance. In which includes axle (bearing) resistance, wheel (rolling) resistance, flange resistance, air resistance, track resistance, curve resistance, and grade resistance. Rolling resistance affects mostly from friction between wheel treads and the running surfaces of rails, while flange resistance results from touching parts between wheel flanges and the inside heads of rails. Track resistance is a function of deflection. Curve resistance represents the additional work needed to overcome wheel-rail friction in curves.

                        Engine or locomotive type is directly impact to determine the fuel consumption during the travelling of a train. Fuel consumption is varying according to either the design of the engine such as diesel hydraulic and diesel electric locomotives. Every engine should have optimum speed or frequency in which fuel efficiency is high compare to the other conditions and this determines the optimum speed of the one ton of the train [36].

                        There are four major resistance forces acting upon a moving train. The propulsion has to overcome these resistance forces and provide the additional forces needs to accelerate or decelerate. The resistance forces acting upon a train is as follows.

                        This force can be projected to parallel and perpendicular directions to the locomotive. The perpendicular force can be neglected, since it is not opposing to the movement of the train. So even if the wind is flowing at angle, it can be taken as the wind is flowing oppose to the direction of motion of the train.</br>

                        Air Resistance is a function of the aero dynamic shape of the train, frontal area and speed of the train. Aero resistance is higher when there are obstacles around the train. If there are gaps between the cars the air resistance increases. This is due to the vortexes in between the carriages. In the freight trains aero dynamic resistance plays a major role due to the variation of wagons. The passenger trains are homogeneous. Because of that the aero dynamic drag of passenger trains are significantly lower than freight trains. </br>

                    <p class="lead"> 
                        When a train is taking a curve the train is forced in to the curve from the forces given by the rails. This force is the centrifugal force, which pushes back the train in order to follow the curve. This resistance has to be overcome by the train propulsion. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead"> 
                        There is another reason for the curve resistance. When a vehicle takes a curve the wheels are rotating at different angular velocities. Rear wheel drive land vehicles overcome this by using a differential gear drive. This scenario is applying to the trains as well. Though the curvature is much lower than in the case of land vehicles. In the Railway the curve is taken using the profile of the wheel and the rail and the placement of the rail. This makes additional friction and additional slip of the rail and the wheel. So there is a resistance force when taking a curve additional to the rolling resistance.

                        The forces on the train is as follows. The forces acting on the train if the train is on the grade and a curve is independent. So these two are calculated from the above equations. And the force needed to accelerate or decelerate is also calculated.

                        Energy requirement is calculated station to station. Driving cycle starts when a train Starts at a certain station and stops at a certain station. And if there are stations in between starting and stopping station the energy is calculated according to the driving cycle.

                        Energy requirement is calculated using the power consumption of the train in order to have required motion. This is calculated for two scenarios. Those two scenarios are accelerating and constant velocity. Deceleration phase doesn’t use engines power but only uses the breaks. This means the engine is on idle after the constant velocity. This means the engine is only used for useful work when accelerating and maintaining the constant velocity (cruising). These two scenarios are analysed as follows.

                        <b>Acceleration</b></br>
                        When accelerating the motive power is providing by the engine. So it is assumed to be the power consumption by the train. Power consumption is adjusted using the efficiency of the overall system of the train which is unique to the locomotive class (locomotive type). This is obtained in the next section.</br>
                        The motive force can be obtained using the following equation.

                        This equation is normally used when an object is moving in a constant velocity. But in this case it can be used by taking the average of initial and final velocity. The initial velocity in a driving cycle is zero and the final velocity is taken as speed limit between two stations. Here the final velocity is the speed restriction. So the acceleration is fixed with the increase of the velocity. The correct scenario is the propulsion resistance is dependent on the velocity of the train. Since it is changing the propulsion resistance changes hence acceleration changes. But using the speed restriction allows the acceleration to be fixed.
