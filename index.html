                    <p class="lead">
                    Transportation network in Sri Lanka consists of two prominent networks, road transportation and railway transportation other than those port, harbors, merchant marines, aviation, and waterways transportation networks can be noticed. Through this transport system, Sri Lanka railway has capability to hold 6.0% passenger transportation and 0.7% goods transportation from the overall transportation demand on Sri Lanka. From many years, Sri Lanka railway runs with operational loss [1], because of inefficiencies and mismanagement, and it has not been update frequently. On behalf of that there is a need of developing an efficient train management system, not only that there are no any mechanism to visualise Development or assist quality of railway network in Sri Lanka. In order to validate the development of railway management in Sri Lanka Quantifying emission is necessary.</p>
                    <p class="lead">
                    Railway transportation can be categorised in to two categories, Passenger and freight transportation. The Railway transportation management includes planning procedures such as Strategic, operational, tactical and short-term. According to the hierarchy of the operation whether the operation is strategic, operational, tactical and short-term, the planning procedure is differed [2]. This research is mainly focus on quantifying emissions with respective to existing management system and develop an algorithm to quantify emissions according to the future developments of the railway system.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                    Developing an algorithm to assist development of Sri Lanka railway is involved with several steps which should be followed. Emission of railway transportation would depend on the several aspect such as Locomotive type, number of passengers, traffic congestion of railway, route condition. Demand analysis involves collecting data related to passenger demand. Network planning involves how the path or the lines are designed effectively. This includes station details including the number of platforms in a station, platform scheduling and shunting [2].Train schedule planning is generally deciding the timetable of the trains. Rolling Stock planning is planning of the locomotives and railway cars. Crew management is the process of managing and allocating crew of the railway transportation in to different operations [2, 3].
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                    Mathematical models on train operations shows that scheduling is how important in development of the railway system. Other than that there are research papers available about emission inventories which has done for different kind of places and areas, which are used to measure the development of the systems and places.

                    <p class="lead">
                        Through our literature review, there were many research that has been done to estimate emission for different places such as Ports, railways and many other areas, large number of researches has been done by interpolating collected data according to conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        While studying about the railway management systems, few significant factors have been identified which makes considerable impact to the fuel efficiency and emission of the locomotives. Those are locomotive type, manufactured year, track profile, load, altitude and driving pattern.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Sri Lankan railway is non-profitable organization, which is established to provide service rather than being profitable organization. Sri Lanka railway pump around three million litters of diesel for their locomotives annually, but travel only 6% present of passengers from total passenger transportation, but in Indian railway this amount is about 50% from total transportation, though our research gap is to perform a base study to develop method to find out carbon emission of Sri Lanka Railway to assist the development and to find capability of minimizing carbon foot print of SLR by improving fuel efficiency.

                    <p class="lead">
                        To develop a model to estimate the fuel consumption of the locomotive under different loading conditions. Energy consumption is one of the most important factor which is directly related with the fuel consumption. Though objectives of this project is based on fuel consumption. Objective which are to carry out mention in below.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="lead">
                        <li>To identify the factors that affect fuel consumption</li>
                        <li>To develop a model to quantify fuel consumption of locomotives</li>
                        <li>Case study to evaluate model</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Over the objectives, there are some other factors which has been motivated to do this project. Those are to compare with alternative methods of transportation with railway transportation, to be used as a base study for the electrification of railway transportation, there is no method to compare with the propose alternatives, to evaluate the effectiveness of train operations to identify potential of optimization.
